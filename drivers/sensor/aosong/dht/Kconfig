config DHT_TIMER_LOCK_IRQS
	bool "Lock IRQs for sensor measurement"
	help
	  Locks IRQs when taking sensor readings, this greatly improves the chances of getting a
	  reading successfully from the sensor at the cost of delayed interrupt servicing (e.g.
	  Bluetooth). Note that other systems might need to be adjusted to account for this.
